# Comp

> We want our users to be able to discover and save pictures they like according to our recommendations.  Our user will input a picture of theirs that they like and find others that are similar according to our technology.  They can then have a collection of similar photos to use for whatever purpose they choose - art work, stock photos for a company site, sharing with friends, etc.
